# ScriptBunniez
Script Kiddie's, no, now it's ScriptBunniez. Introducing ScriptBunniez, the new open-source Swiss army knife for people who are new to WiFi-Deauthing and WiFi-WPA2 password cracking. Written in BASH, it is lightweight and runs smoothly with Linux distributions. This script is now up and ready to BASH some networks...

How to Install and Execute:
1. Make sure you have a WiFi 802.11 Auditing NIC adapter, if you aren't familiar look it up on Google. They are usually cheap and easy to find
2. To download and run the BASH script go into Linux CLI and use wget or git clone to grab the files from the URL: https://github.com/bunn1ez/Script-Bunniez, then make sure that you run the script in sudo after you give it executable permissions with 'chmod +x ScriptBunniez'
3. Make sure the wordlist for WPA2 cracking is in the same directory you run the script in.
4. Here is an Amazon link to an 802.11 dual wave; 2.4GHz & 5GHz WiFi Dongle:
